<em>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</em><br>
                    If HTML and CSS are the structure and style of the website, Javascript is what enables interactive content. Drop down menus, forms, calculations, etc.<br>
                    Javascript is interesting because its executed 'client side', which means when we are visiting a page our browser will download the script and process it on our computer rather than the interwebs. This makes a lot of the processing much faster as  it doesn't rely on connection speed or quality.<br><br>
                    <em>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</em><br>
                    'Control flow' is the order that the computer executes a script's statements, its usually a logical/orderly pattern. You must read each bit of the code in order from start to finish, also you must look at how things are structured + how this may change things.<br>
                    Loops are code that quickly/easily do something repeatively. As far as I understand it atm, it's code that, when finished, will take you back to the start of its control flow and run through everything again (the same as before). It wil do this forever until a preset condition is met telling the loop to do otherwise.<br>
                    This makes me think of the famous Micky Mouse piece in Fantasia, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", where the magic broom is given the loop task of filling the pool with buckets of water from the well but isn't told to stop when the pool is full - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DX2yVucz24"><em>entertainment ensures</em></a><br>
                    An Example:<br>
                    I have a set routine of what I do in the morning, its all very structured and orderly... Wake up, get out of bed, clothes on, walk dog, shower, breakfast... I do the same thing every morning. These steps would be the "control flow" of my morning's script.<br>
                    The fact that I do it every day the same we can think of as the loop, you execute it to completion (lets say all the way through to when I go to sleep), then the loop starts over.<br>
                    However, there may be conditions that will cause the loop to halt and something else to happen e.g. I go to walk the dog but the dog has escaped, now I have to look for the dog, I may not have time for my shower or breakfast before work.<br>
                    This new event that has been triggered may be a new loop, a single event, or...<br><br>
                    <em>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</em><br>
                    I'm not sure I have my head around this completely but I think if you want to access numerically indexed data you use arrays, and for non-numeric data you use objects.<br>
                    Just now I am reading that, in fact, everything in JavaScript is an object, arrays are objects that are just slightly modified.<br><br>
                    <em>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</em><br>
                    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Its sitting there all primed and waiting for the command to get into action. There can be other commands that call it into action. It's like a surprise party sitting waiting quietly for the right person to come walking in.

<h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">Javascript is very different from HMTL and CSS. Each of these three have their own part to play when creating a website. Javascript is used to create the interactive elements of a website, whereas HTML and CSS are more static. HTML defines the structure and CSS defines the design, the looks.</p>

                    <p class="plain-content">
                    Control flow means that code is run from the beginnning to the end UNLESS a condition or a loop is encountered which will instruct otherwise. Applied to the process of 'waking up' you could have the alarm going off, switching off the alarm and getting up, which means the full code has been run. But it is also possible to build in a condition where the alarm is switched off, but you are not getting up, instead sleeping further. If that scenario happens, not all code is run (ie the 'getting up' part isn't), but the code has still run correctly.</p>

                    The difference is that with data in an object, you can use a string to access the data within the object, but with array you have to use a numeric key. Exampe of the same information stored in an array and a non-array object:<br>
                    Array: var pets = ["cat", "dog", "goldfish"]<br>
                    Object: var pets = {pet1: cat, pet2: dog, pet3: goldfish}<br>
                    Accessing the data in the array is done by using an index in brackets: "pets[2]" which will return "Goldfish" as we start counting at zero.
                    Accessing the data in the object using the string: "pets.pet2" which will return "dog".</p>

                    A function is a contained piece of code that performs a particular task. They are useful, because once a function is written, it is reusable, it can be called again and again without having to re-write the same code multiple times at various locations. </p>

<h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>
                    JavaScript enables us to implement interactive designs/functions whereas HTML structures content of web pages
                    with paragraphs, lists, images, tables etc and CSS decorates websites by styling the color, the size and the
                    position of letters, and setting the background.

                <p>
                    Control flow is like 'Deciding what to cook for dinner'. For example, "If I have pasta and minced beef, I cook bolognese.",
                    "If I have a lot of vegetables, I cook minestrone soup". Loops are like chopping vegetables just like "cut this vegetable
                    until it is in small pieces".

                   Arrays are used when the data is labelled numerically and is ordered whereas objects are used when the data is labelled 
                   semantically but unordered.

                    A function is a group of code created to implement a series of processes when they are called. It is convinient as      people do not have to write the same code every time they need it.
