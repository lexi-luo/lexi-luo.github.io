                <p>
                    <em>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem:</em><br>
                    The easiest example I can think of for this was the final part of sprint-5.<br>
                    We had a fairly straight forward task of adding in code to make a very basic 'game' work. There was a grid of squares and we needed to make the squares change different colours when you clicked on them; squares could be blue, green or invisible.<br>
                    I managed to get this part working without much hassle.<br>
                    Once we had that part working we needed to get a counter going that would count how many blue, green, and invisible squares were on the board.<br>
                    This final part was relatively simple in concept but damned if I could get my thoughts straight on how to arrange my code to express this.<br>
                    I wrote the Pseudocode first then made attempt after attempt at translating it, I just couldn't think of the right commands to express what I was thinking.<br>
                    Then I went to the help material provided; I would read through it all, find something useful, think I could suddenly write it, then realise it wasn't right, and repeat.<br>
                    Eventually I thought I had the code to count the blue squares so I ran it, suddenly the squares in the 'game' would no longer change colour when clicked. Bugger.<br>
                    I wanted to check it was the new bit of code for the counter that was kooking things, so I removed it and ran the code again. Squares are changing colour.<br>
                    That confirmed my new code wasn't right and was upsetting the old code somehow. I looked and looked and couldn't think what was wrong.<br>
                    I started to wonder if I was calling my commands wrong, my mind was going around and around and confusing myself. I eventually convinced myself I had to put my commands into a function and tried that. Didn't work.<br>
                    I knew I had reached my limit so broke off and started trying to contact others, had a few suggestions, then came back to it the next day.<br>
                    I was still communicating with peers and was asked to push to GitHub so they could take a closer look at things. As I was doing so I decided to remove the function part, it just didn't feel right.<br>
                    As I was doing that I noticed a curley bracket that seemed out of place. I deleted it and ran the code, success!

                    To be honest, I can't recall any examples. I know I have but can't remember the specifics.<br>
                    I know I have found a couple of good examples to use as templates through Google. MDN web docs has had a lot of useful pieces.<br>
                    Looking at other people's work around the internet and checking out how they solved things via the developer's tools has been helpful too.<br>
                    I was feeling tight on time when I was re-designing my web page so in the end I stripped it right back to basics and ended up finding I liked the clean, simple feel of it all. I have some room to go back and tidy up but I'm really happy with how it all works atm.<br>
                    Otherwise I've mostly been following the suggestions of the course as I've gone along.

                    In general; I've found taking time to step back and do other things resets the mind and is the most effective for overcoming a block.<br>
                    If it's a case of entering territory I just don't know or understand then talking to someone is tops. I'm trying not to but I really love knowing the answer first and working backward to see how it all works, things stick in my mind more if I do it this way but I know I can't always rely on there being an answer available.

                    <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">The problem that seems to get me most often is knowing what I want to code in Javascript, but not knowing how to do it in such a way that it works.</p>
                    <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">I retrace my steps. Often we would have learned about the principle in either this sprint or a previous sprint. Of course the examples used never match the problem I am trying to solve! At that point I try to google and see if I can find any tips. When I really can't figure it out I look at the answer. When I do, I analyse the answer until I understand what the approach was.</p>
                    <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">Sometimes a little frustrated, but it is very satisfying when you do solve something that got you stuck for a while.</p>
                    <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">- Before Phase 0 I didn't know what I didn't know. Now I know what I don't know (and it's a lot). <br>
                        - Using google to find an answer requires skill. Often the results coming back are too difficult or just don't apply. Thinking about how to phrase you search term is an art.<br>
                        - I like the Eloquent Javascript book and am going to buy that so I can keep it handy for referencing it.  <br>
                        - I often think too difficult, start simple then expand.</p>
